Solution
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
 

Note: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.
